THE PROBLEM
Gentrification is a process of changing the character of a neighborhood through the influx of more affluent residents and businesses. And it is a crucial step in the development of cities around the United States. Gentrification often involves an increase in housing prices, the number of evictions, and a change in the retail, consumer goods landscape in the region. Lives of the people, rich or poor, are affected by such a phenomenon. The process is a gradual change and often hidden in trivial aspects of peopleâ€™s daily life. We want to use big data to identify such trends. 
The question that we ultimately want to answer is whether the change in the restaurants in the region can tell a story about gentrification. 

WHY IT IS IMPORTANT
This problem is important to us because predicting gentrification can help us better make suitable policies for residents in the region, help businesses survive in change and the people live a more manageable life.

DATASET
Kaggle, the world-leading data challenge database, provides us plenty of dataset in the correlated fields about gentrification, restaurant as well as crime data. 
For this specific project, we are focusing on gentrification and the restaurant data in New York City. The datasets we want to use includes the NYC restaurant datasets, NYC crimes datasets, etc. The dataset sources are listed as follows:
NYC Restaurant Inspections

NYC crimes 
https://www.kaggle.com/adamschroeder/crimes-new-york-city#NYPD_Complaint_Data_Historic.csv
https://www.kaggle.com/new-york-state/new-york-state-index-crimes

HOW CAN WE USE THE DATASET
To analyze the restaurant data in New York City, 
We will analyze the datasets XXXXXXX using the XXXXXX.
